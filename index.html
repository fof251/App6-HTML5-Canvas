Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this assignment is to learn how to display thing such as an image or shape onto a canvas. The goal of this code is to have 4 buttons, each with a different purpose. 
One button draws a rectangle on the canvas, another button puts one's name on the canvas, another button loads an image of something onto the canvas, and the last button clears the canvas.
<!--Added in Goal of Code instead of blah, blah, blah--!>


<!--Known Issues:
There are no known issues in App 6.-->
<!--Edited blah, blah, blah--!>
