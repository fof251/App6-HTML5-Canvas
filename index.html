Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this assignment is to learn how to display thing such as an image or shape onto a canvas. The goal of this code is to have 4 buttons, each with a different purpose. 
One button draws a rectangle on the canvas, another button puts one's name on the canvas, another button loads an image of something onto the canvas, and the last button clears the canvas.
<!--Added in Goal of Code instead of blah, blah, blah--!>


<!--Known Issues:
There are no known issues in App 6.-->
<!--Edited blah, blah, blah--!>

//This is the button function that is supposed to draw a rectangle on a canvas
//This function was in the wrong place before so it appeared as text instead of being actual code
//Also did not work because I was calling the wrong name and the wrong canvas

	var art_context = art_canvas.getContext("2d"); //came back and added art in front of context because it did not work before with just context

	art_context.fillText("Faith F", 10, 50); //The text that should appear should say "Faith F"

	apple.src = 'apple1.jpg' //This line of code calls for the attached apple1.jpg file attached separtely  
	art_context.drawImage(apple, 5, 5); //changed from (20,10) to (5,5) because the whole image did not show up on the canvas
}
//This is the button that is supposed to make an image display on the canvas
//The image is in JPG format
//The image is a small animated apple that I retrieved from Google Images


function clear_art () {
	var art_canvas = document.getElementById("art"); //canvas element (must include in each button function)
	var art_context = art_canvas.getContext("2d"); //came back and added art in front of context because it did not work before with just context 
	art_context.clearRect(0, 0, 300, 200); //The rectangle this line of code is referring to is the entire canvas
}

//This is the button that should be pressed to clear all elements on the canvas
//In other words, when this button is pressed the canvas returns to its original blank and empty state
